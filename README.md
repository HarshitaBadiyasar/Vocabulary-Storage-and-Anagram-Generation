# Vocabulary-Storage-and-Anagram-Generation
- Developed a program implementing a HashMap with quadratic probing to store and search a large vocabulary file, optimizing
for efficient memory utilization and fast search performance
- Implemented an algorithm for generating anagrams of input words/phrases from the vocabulary file with optimal time
complexity, showcasing effective data structure and algorithm design for word processing tasks with efficient memory usage
